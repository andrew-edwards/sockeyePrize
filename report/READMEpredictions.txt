Doing each stock in a separate folder. Chilko was first and has a longer .Rmd.

fraser_covariates are created in report/analysis-2025-3.Rmd. That was used as a
template for fraser/chilko/analysis-2025-4.Rmd, which is then used as a whittled
down template for each stock in turn (saves changing cache names etc.). So each
stock has a separate subdirectory. Doing new stocks in desktop 4. Writing notes
here (so not duplicating in .Rmd).

For Chilko, we used PDO and then BI separately, PDO came out best for both
age4 and age5 and so for other stocks we are just going to do PDO to save
time. So Chilko has extra code for picking the best run for age4 and age5, not
needed for later ones. Late Stuart onwards has time series code which could go back into
Chilko also.

Didn't have time to add in Carrie's longer SST time series, which has some
NA's which will need thinking about (see her email).

For each .Rmd, change the knit_exit chunks to eval = FALSE, and manually check
things - just read through.

Raft age4s - I hadn't noticed that is has the same issues as Stellako (can't
make early predictions. Presume it's the same reason as for Stellako - see that
text for details and code (no time to run it now). Took about 14hours to run the
age5s, all for a predition of only 2,555 fish!

Stellako age4s - all SVEs had sst_spring (starts in 1982) or zooplankton (starts
even later), which means they can't make predictions before 1985, so the MVE
cannot either. See the .Rmd for more details.

Bristol Bay
***********

Going to do four separate calculations then combine them (1.2, 1.3, 2.2,
2.3). So wrangle the data differently (not combining ages) than for Fraser River.

bristol-bay/bristol-bay-covariates.Rmd to make bristol_bay_covariates, based on
 report/analysis-2025-3.Rmd for Fraser River (also did some analyses in that).

Probably use report/analysis-2025-4.Rmd as template for the analyses (i.e. not a
later modified one from a river subdirectory). Actually, might be best to use
the latest simpler one, and just add anything else in that's needed. No need for
correlation plots. Aha - given so few covariates, we don't need to manually
reduce them (like we did for age5 based on age4 results for F River), so can just set one
up and then copy for the others. And should hopefully run fairly quickly.


Timings. Each extra lag should be $2^XX$ longer.

9 lags - 3.8 seconds

12 lags - 21 seconds (8 times longer, makes sense.

14 lags - 90 seconds (makes sense, four times longer, ish)

15 lags - 200 secs, about three minutes (makes sense).

16 lags - should be about 320 seconds, 5 minutes.

17 lags - took 720 seconds, 12 minutes before. Then 1587 secs, 26 minutes at
home.

18 lags - probably about an hour, so a sensible limit.

21 lags (Raft) - presumably 8 hours. Took 10 but crashed computer but .rds for
age5 had saved. So for long ones just do not cache the calculation and saveRDS
chunk, or the readRDS chunk.

Write up of methods:

Multiview embedding with environmental covariates

We used multiview embedding, a form of empirical dynamic modelling. Rather than
define mechanistic models, the approach translates time series of data into a path through a
multi-dimensional space, whose axes are lagged values of the variables. We
modelled each stock separately, and included various relevant environmental
covariates. These were sea-surface temperature, Pink Salmon abundance in the
North Pacific, Fraser River discharge, zooplankton in the Strait of Georgia, the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Pacific Current Bifurcation index.

All code is available at https://github.com/andrew-edwards/sockeyePrize, though
is not easily usable by anyone else at the moment and there are various
improvements we would make. Most of the covariates were taken from our pacea R package.

See above. All our results are saved as .pdf files, but are not really written in a concise way that would be easily understandable by others. There is also one .pdf file (generated from R Markdown files available in our GitHub site) for each stock.
We used previously published methods and our two public R packages (pacea and pbsEDM). Our work is fully reproducible and traceable, just not easily run by others at the moment.
Doing retrospectives would be prohibitively difficult with our current set
up. We aim to refine our methods for next year.


Columbia ran but crashed when building pdf, need to not print so many
results. See below for error.

Kvichak has age12 of 7.7 million (I think) but has the worst correlation so far.

Future ideas: Late Stuart has a kind of regime change, could try fitting from
1999 onwards (Zooplankton might come into play then).
Longer SST time series should be good - see notes in Stellako analysis.
